# Easter Trivia Game

Easter Trivia game is using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

This is how the game works:
There are 8 multiple choice questions and player can only pick one answer per question.
The player will have a limited amount of time (120 seconds) to finish the quiz.
The game ends when the time runs out or when all questions are answered before time running out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answered correctly.
